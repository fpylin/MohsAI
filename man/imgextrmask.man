.TH imgextramask.py 1 "April 2021" "Version 1.0" "User Manual for imgextramask.py Python script"

.SH NAME
imgextramask.py - extracts the ground truth mask from a labelled ground truth image and calculates two-class statistics of a predicted mask.

.SH SYNOPSIS
imgextramask.py [SourceImage] [SourceImageLabelledGroundTruth] [PredictedMask]

.SH DESCRIPTION
imgextramask.py is a Python script that extracts the ground truth mask from a labelled ground truth image and calculates two-class statistics of a predicted mask. 

The predicted mask is obtained by performing image subtraction, logical OR and thresholding operations on the source and ground truth images using the OpenCV library.

The script prints the following two-class statistics for the predicted mask:
- width: the width of the image in pixels
- height: the height of the image in pixels
- pixels: the total number of pixels in the image
- tp: the number of true positives
- fn: the number of false negatives
- fp: the number of false positives
- tn: the number of true negatives
- sens: the sensitivity
- spec: the specificity
- ppv: the positive predictive value
- npv: the negative predictive value
- f1: the F1 score
- jaccard: the Jaccard similarity coefficient
- acc: the accuracy

.SH OPTIONS
The script does not accept any options.
